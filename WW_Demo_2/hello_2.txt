Hello there! Why, I thought you'd never return! 

This place... seems a little unstable...

Maybe it'll become more stable as the night grows on.

Either way, I'm happy you returned.

I know it's hard to follow me around all the time. 

I'm thanakful that you do it. 

Listen, things might be changing soon...

But don't fret, I'm we'll still get to talk! 

In the months that come, this land will be shifting all about! 

New worlds will take shape, new heroes will arise out of the ashes of old. 

And here we'll be, witnessing it together! Won't it be fun?

You... you don't look very excited... What? You don't think it will happen? Surely, have some faith for once! It'll happen at some point. It has to! 

But until it does, you can come back to me every night. 

I move around a lot, so I emplore you to have some haste. 

If you pay attention you'll be fine! 

Hey, listen, I gotta go! It's been nice catching up with you! See you tomorrow, little dear!
